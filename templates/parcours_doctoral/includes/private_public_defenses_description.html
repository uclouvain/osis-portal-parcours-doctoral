      The final text of your thesis must be submitted to thesis exam board members no later than one month before the private defence date.
      This date must be chosen collectively by the board and in agreement with the PhD student.
      The board must be present in its entirety at the private defence and, barring exceptions, at the public defence.
      Thesis submission format (paper and/or digital) is determined by agreement with each board member.
