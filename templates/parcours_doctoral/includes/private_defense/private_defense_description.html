      The provisional text of your thesis must be sent to thesis exam board members no later than one month before the
      date set for the private defence.
      The manuscript format may vary from one Subject-specific PhD Committee (CDD) to another; please ask your
      administrator for details.
      The submission method (paper and/or digital) must be agreed with each thesis exam board member.
      The thesis exam board must be present in full at the private defence.
      The date must therefore be chosen collectively by the board in agreement with the PhD student.
