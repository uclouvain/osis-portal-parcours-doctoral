      Before your defence, you must submit your thesis electronically to the DIAL electronic thesis repository
      (<a href="{{ url }}" target="_blank">{{ url }}</a>). Before you do so, please enter
      the metadata using the form below. Please also indicate your chosen distribution conditions
      (open or restricted access, blocking for a certain period, etc.), after discussing these with your supervisors.
      You will then receive an email confirming that your supervisor has approved the distribution, followed by an
      email from the library team regarding the deposit formalities to be completed in their DIAL application.
